#### Personal Information

Visa usa now requires customers to provide us with personal information (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use our services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured only when a visitor accesses Online Services, or speaks on the phone with a Visa usa now employee, and willingly discloses that information. This disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts customer service, or participates in content submissions.

Certain personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or state government, or with a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name become public information when its articles of incorporation are filed.

#### Data Protection

Visa usa now takes precautions to ensure that access to databases containing customer information is available only from within Morgan Harris Group 's internal network. Further, we typically encrypt financial information during transmission, or use secure protocols. No protocol, encryption, or other precaution can provide complete security for electronic data, so we don’t provide a guarantee of security.
