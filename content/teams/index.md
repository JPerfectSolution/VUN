#### Termination of Agreements and Refunds Policy
We offer a refund policy subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

After the applications have been submitted, we will refund 50% of the fee paid. Payments made on customer’s behalf to the State Department site cannot be refunded under any circumstances.

Visa USA Now reserves the right to alter, change, amend or delete fees at its sole option. Visa USA Now further reserves the right to institute new services and charge fees in association with the provision of such new services as it deems appropriate. Visa USA Now reserves the right to offer subsequent promotional rates which may or may not be more favorable than the terms under which you entered this agreement.

Payment of Fees – Visa USA Now accepts payment by credit and debit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover). In addition, Visa USA Now may from time to time allow additional forms of payment however the offering of a particular form of payment does not obligate Visa USA Now to continue to offer that form of payment in the future. The current list of payment options will be displayed during the order process. If you have any questions concerning the current available payment options, please email us at info@visausaNow.com.
