**&#8220;Micro-Donations for all causes&#8221;**

Giverr offers 17 screens each for the end user version on iOS and Android. There is also a tablet admin app that allows Giverr staff and organisations to manage their profiles and activity, which includes another 12 screens.

The app embraces heavily custom vector animations from background animations to main feature actions to ensure immersive, addictive, and professional user experience. The app also features guest login with local storage to provide an even easier onboarding process for new users.

Finally, we use the best tech such as RealmDB and DeepLinking! Included in this project was also a marketing WordPress website, server backend & setup and social media setup.

Summary:
  
Giverr has a total of four different platforms that each took
  
**three weeks or less** to develop.
